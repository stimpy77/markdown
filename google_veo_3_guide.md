# Cinematic AI Storytelling with Google Veo 3: A Comprehensive Guide

> First draft

## Introduction

Google **Veo 3** represents a new leap in text-to-video generation, bringing advanced cinematic control and **character consistency** to AI filmmaking. Building on earlier tools like Runway Gen-4, Veo 3 not only improves visual fidelity but for the first time can generate **audio** in sync with its videos – from ambient sounds to characters speaking dialogue. The model excels at understanding nuanced prompts and complex scenes, producing realistic motion and physics with stunning prompt adherence. Most importantly for storytellers, Veo 3 is designed to maintain a cohesive **visual world** across multiple shots, allowing the same characters, props, and locations to persist from clip to clip.

Veo 3 is accessed through Google’s new **Flow** AI filmmaking platform, which encourages a multi-clip workflow much like shooting a film scene-by-scene. Instead of one long render, you’ll generate a sequence of short cinematic clips and edit them together for a complete story. This guide will walk you through how to harness Veo 3 and Flow for cinematic storytelling – with a strong focus on keeping characters and visuals consistent across shots. We assume you have experience with AI video tools (like Runway Gen-4) and are now ready to explore Veo 3’s capabilities.

This guide covers:

* **Core Veo 3 workflow & features** – how Veo 3 operates within the Flow tool, what’s new (audio, camera controls, etc.), and how it differs from earlier workflows.
* **Maintaining character consistency** across multiple clips – best practices to ensure your protagonist looks the same in scene after scene, and your world stays cohesive.
* **Prompting strategies** for cinematic composition – how to write prompts that specify camera angles, movement, lighting, and even sound, to achieve film-like results.
* **Budget-aware tips** – working within credit limits, planning shots efficiently, and using draft vs. final generations to control costs.
* **Visual continuity techniques** – ensuring consistent environments, color tones, and props throughout your story, including the use of recurring motifs for storytelling impact.
* **Key use cases** – examples where Veo 3 shines: music videos (intercutting performance and narrative), short films with dialogue, and more.
* **Step-by-step music video walkthrough** – a detailed case study creating a music video (themes of compassion, betrayal, redemption) using an example script, demonstrating planning, prompting, and editing.
* **Practical tips & troubleshooting** – guidance on prompt structures, avoiding common pitfalls, and tweaking your approach when things go wrong.

By the end, you’ll have a clear game plan for using **Google Veo 3** to weave longer narratives out of short AI-generated clips – all while keeping your characters and visual story world consistent from the first frame to the last.

## 1. Understanding Veo 3’s Workflow and Capabilities

### 1.1 Veo 3 in Flow: Overview of Features

Google Veo 3 is the latest state-of-the-art generative video model, introduced in May 2025 as a major upgrade over Veo 2. It’s deployed via **Flow**, an AI filmmaking application that integrates Veo 3 for video, Imagen 4 for image generation, and Gemini (AI language models) for intelligent prompting. At a high level, Veo 3’s capabilities include:

* **Text-to-Video Generation with Audio** – You input a text description (and optionally reference images), and Veo 3 outputs a short video clip *with sound*. This sound can include background ambience, sound effects, and even synchronized character speech. For example, a prompt of *“a busy city street”* can come with traffic noise in the audio, or a scene of two people talking can produce audible dialogue matching their lip movements. This is a first for AI video generators – earlier models (like Gen-4) were silent by default.
* **High Fidelity, Cinematic Quality** – Veo 3 excels at generating **realistic lighting, textures, and camera motion**, yielding footage that looks far more natural and filmic than prior-gen models. It handles complex physics (water, fire, fabric movement) with improved realism, and reduces odd glitches. It’s also better at following the creative details in your prompt, thanks to training with Google’s Gemini language models for better understanding of nuanced descriptions.
* **Longer Prompt Understanding** – You can describe a **sequence of actions or a multi-sentence scenario** in one go, and Veo 3 will attempt to interpret and visualize the whole sequence. This is more advanced than earlier models which often struggled with lengthy prompts. However, packing too much into one prompt can lead to multiple cuts or jumbled results (we’ll address strategies to control this). The key is that Veo 3 can handle story-like prompts (“Person A does X, then Y happens…”) better than before, making it easier to get cinematic story beats in one generation.
* **Character and Object Consistency Tools** – While each Veo 3 clip is generated in isolation, the Flow platform provides tools to maintain consistency across clips. You can create **“ingredients”** (custom assets) such as a character’s face or a key object, and reuse them in multiple shots with the same appearance. You can also use **Scene Builder** to string clips together: for example, generate one shot and then directly generate the next shot as a continuation, carrying over the character and setting. These features are pivotal for storytelling, and we’ll dive deeper in Section 2.
* **Camera Movement and Cinematic Controls** – Flow gives you direct control over camera angles and movement for Veo 3 clips. In your prompt (or via UI sliders), you can specify shots like *“handheld close-up”*, *“wide establishing shot with slow pan”*, *“dolly-in toward the subject”*, etc., and Veo 3 will respect these directions. This was not possible in Gen-4’s fully text-based approach; now you have a virtual camera operator at your command. We’ll discuss specific prompting tips for camera work in Section 3.
* **Integration with Imagen (Text-to-Image)** – Flow lets you generate still images using **Imagen 4** (Google’s latest image model) and use them as assets in your video workflow. This is extremely useful for “pre-visualization”: you can create a reference image of a character or location, and then tell Veo 3 to use that as a basis for video clips. (Direct image uploads aren’t supported in the initial release, but generating reference images within the app is a workaround.) This two-pronged approach is similar in spirit to Runway Gen-4’s image+video stages, but in Flow it’s more seamless.
* **Credit-Based Generation** – Like many AI platforms, Flow uses a credit system. Users on the **Google AI Ultra** plan get early access to Veo 3 (with audio) and a monthly allotment of generation credits. Each video generation currently costs about **150 credits per clip**, regardless of length or content. So a subscriber might start with e.g. 12,500 credits (the number given at launch) – roughly enough for \~83 clips. This means planning your shots is important: you want to maximize your creative output while minimizing wasted generations. Don’t worry, we’ll provide budget-conscious tips (like using shorter tests or the older Veo 2 for drafts) in Section 4.

**How long is each clip?** Veo 3’s clip length isn’t rigidly fixed to 5 or 10 seconds like Gen-4, but in practice it’s designed for **short scenes**. Flow is *“not about creating long videos”* in one go; instead, you should generate sequences of brief shots (anywhere from 3–15 seconds is common) and then stitch them together. Keeping clips short ensures the model can maintain quality and focus – and it aligns with the cinematic workflow of capturing individual shots. You can always generate multiple clips back-to-back for a longer scene and merge them. Some creators have noted that if you describe too many sequential events in one prompt, Veo 3 might insert its own cuts or camera changes to fit it all in. It’s usually better to stick to **one distinct moment or action per generation**, or explicitly use the Scene Builder to handle a succession of actions (for a controlled transition).

**Summary of Veo 3 vs. previous generation:** To put it plainly, Veo 3 is a major step up in **quality, coherence, and control**. It produces more cinematic results out-of-the-box, and it provides native solutions to key storytelling needs (sound and character continuity) that previously required workarounds. Table 1 below highlights some of the differences:

| Capability                | Veo 2 / Gen-4 (Earlier Gen)                                | **Veo 3 (New)**                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Video Resolution**      | \~480p–720p (approx., lower fidelity)                      | Higher clarity (HD-range visuals)                                                |
| **Max Clip Duration**     | 5–10 s per clip (Gen-4)                                    | \~5–15 s typical (multi-clip workflow)                                           |
| **Audio Generation**      | ❌ No (silent video)                                        | **✅ Yes** – generates ambient sound & dialogue                                   |
| **Prompt Adherence**      | Good, but struggled with long prompts                      | **Great** – handles longer, story-like prompts well                              |
| **Physics & Motion**      | Decent (some jitter or artifacts)                          | **Improved** – smooth motion, realistic physics                                  |
| **Character Consistency** | Only via manual hacks (e.g. reference images between gens) | **Supported** – use Ingredients or Scene Builder for consistent characters       |
| **Camera Control**        | Limited (no explicit control, random outcomes)             | **Explicit** – prompt or set camera moves, angles                                |
| **Multimodality**         | Text prompts, image input (for Gen-4 image stage)          | Text prompts; reference images via Imagen (upload pending)                       |
| **Output Formats**        | Video (no sound)                                           | Video with sound (Flow preview), plus separate downloadable video & audio tracks |
| **Typical Use Cases**     | Short looping clips, simple scenes                         | Complex scenes, narrative sequences, music videos with sound, etc.               |

*Table 1: Comparison of earlier AI video generation vs. Google Veo 3.*

In practice, you will be using Veo 3 through the **Flow interface**. The workflow can be thought of in three phases:

* **Phase 1: Pre-Production (Planning & Assets)** – You break down your story into scenes/shots, and create any necessary assets. For example, you might generate a reference image of your main character using text-to-image (Imagen 4) or select some real photos for inspiration. You mentally plan the visual style and how each shot will look. This phase is all about setup, similar to storyboarding and casting in a real film.
* **Phase 2: Generation (Veo 3 Clip Creation)** – You write prompts and generate videos clip by clip. Each clip is typically a few seconds focusing on one shot or moment. You’ll leverage Flow’s tools here: possibly using Scene Builder to maintain continuity in a sequence, or recalling an “ingredient” (like the character you designed) in each prompt. After each generation, you review the clip. If it’s not right, you might iterate (tweak the prompt and regenerate) before moving on. As you generate, you’ll keep an eye on your credit budget.
* **Phase 3: Post-Production (Editing & Polish)** – Once you have all the clips for your project, you’ll edit them together outside of Flow (using a video editor of your choice, e.g. Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve). Here you will cut the clips in sequence, overlay the **audio** (for example, the music track in a music video), adjust timing, add titles or effects, etc. You might also do minor color grading to ensure the clips match perfectly, or sync any dialogue. Essentially, you treat the AI-generated clips as raw footage and polish the final film. Flow does allow you to preview scenes with multiple shots on a timeline (and even export a rough cut), but currently it may have limitations (for instance, early users found that exporting a multi-shot scene from Flow could drop the audio). Thus, a traditional editing pass is still recommended for the best result.

Next, we’ll dive deeper into the *most critical aspect* for storytelling: keeping your characters and visuals consistent across all those clips in Phase 2.

## 2. Maintaining Character Consistency and Visual Continuity

One of the hardest challenges in AI video generation is ensuring that the **same character** appears reliably in shot after shot without morphing, and that the environment stays recognizable. Veo 3, in conjunction with Flow, provides tools to achieve this, but you still need a solid strategy. This section covers how to create and reuse characters, how to use Flow’s Scene Builder to chain shots, and how to maintain a cohesive look throughout your film.

### 2.1 Creating Your Characters (Ingredients)

Before generating full scenes, it helps to “lock in” the appearance of key characters. In traditional filmmaking you’d cast actors; with Veo 3 you will *design* your characters either through text prompts or reference images:

* **Use Imagen (Text-to-Image) for Character Portraits:** In Flow’s interface you can switch to an image generation mode (powered by Imagen 4) to create high-quality portraits or concept art of your characters. For example, if your story’s protagonist is a **24-year-old compassionate caregiver**, you can prompt an image of her face and save it. A sample prompt might be:

  ```text
  Portrait of a compassionate young woman, 24 years old, light brown hair in a ponytail, gentle eyes and a warm smile, soft natural lighting.
  ```

  This yields a clear image of the character’s face and overall look (hair style, eye color, etc.). You could do the same for other main characters: e.g. a portrait of the **singer** in a music video (describe their age, hairstyle, wardrobe style), or a **villain/friend** character (with the traits you need). **Save these images as “ingredients”** in Flow – essentially giving each character a label or name. *For instance, you might label the young woman “Caregiver” and the singer “Vocalist.”* These ingredients serve as your digital “cast.”

* **Consistency via Ingredients:** Once you have an ingredient created, you can reference it in your video prompts. Flow allows you to simply mention the character in plain language in subsequent prompts, and it will attempt to use that same generated character model. For example, if you generated and saved an image of *Alice (a young caregiver)*, you can later prompt: *“Alice walks into the hospital room carrying a tray.”* The model will render a woman matching Alice’s appearance. Under the hood, Flow knows “Alice” refers to that ingredient. If Flow doesn’t yet let you name them explicitly, you can achieve the same effect by **using the same descriptive prompt language every time** (e.g. always say “young ponytailed woman” for Alice). Consistency in text descriptors will cue the model to stick to one look.

* **Handling Wardrobe and Props:** Note that Veo 3 may change a character’s clothing between generations unless told otherwise. If your protagonist should always wear a *blue cardigan*, be sure to mention that detail in each prompt (or at least frequently enough). Alternatively, generate a full-body reference image that includes their outfit, not just a headshot. Flow’s ingredients currently are image-based; however, as of launch, direct image upload is not supported. This means you cannot import a photo of a real person to use – you’ll rely on AI-generated reference images or just textual consistency. In practice, the AI-generated faces can be unique enough to carry a story, even if they’re not a specific actor.

* **Environment and Key Object Ingredients:** Character consistency isn’t the only continuity concern – what about a distinct location or prop that recurs (say, the **house interior** where many scenes take place, or a **special item** like a necklace or in our case, a **coffee mug** that appears throughout)? You can also generate still images of these. For example, create an image of “a cozy bedroom with morning light through a window” to define the look of a location, or an image of “a blue ceramic mug with a chipped handle” to establish a prop’s design. While Veo 3 can generate such things on the fly, having a reference image as an ingredient can help later if you need to ensure the mug looks the same in multiple shots (same color, shape, etc.). In Flow, you might not directly *name* these props, but again consistent description works (always call it “the antique blue mug” in prompts, and the model will try to recall that style).

> 💡 *Example:* If you plan a motif of a **broken cup** symbolizing betrayal (one of our use case themes), you might generate an image of that cup intact, and another of it broken, to use at different points. By describing it the same way (“grandma’s ceramic mug”), Veo 3 will carry over the visual details. In our music video example, a **cup/mug** is indeed a recurring symbol – shared in early scenes, shattered in the betrayal, and later seen repaired.

### 2.2 Scene Builder: Shot-by-Shot Consistency

Flow’s **Scene Builder** feature is the primary tool for maintaining continuity between back-to-back shots. It allows you to generate a sequence of shots that Flow treats as one “scene,” so it will attempt to keep the character and setting consistent from one shot to the next. Here’s how to make the most of it:

* **Continuous vs. Discontinuous Shots:** When you finish generating one shot in Flow, instead of starting a completely new prompt for the next, you can click **“Add to Scene”** (or a similar button) to create the next shot in sequence. By doing so, Flow knows the next clip is a continuation of the same scene. You can then write a prompt for Shot 2 without re-describing everything from scratch – just describe what happens next or from which angle. For example, Shot 1 might be *“Alice enters the room and sets the tray down.”* Then using Add to Scene, Shot 2’s prompt could be *“Close-up on Alice’s face as she smiles reassuringly.”* Flow will keep Alice’s appearance the same (since it’s presumably the same Alice ingredient in the scene context) and keep the room looking like the same room.

* **Camera Transitions and Continuous Motion:** A powerful aspect of Scene Builder is the ability to create **smooth transitions**. Because the system has context of the previous shot, it can generate Shot 2 starting from the last frame of Shot 1 if desired, giving the effect of one continuous take or a motivated cut. For instance, you can generate a wide shot of a character picking up the mug, then the next shot as a seamless push-in from that moment (like a cut that looks and feels fluid). Flow is designed to handle *“revealing more of the action or transitioning to what happens next with continuous motion”*. This is especially useful if you want to do something like a single camera move that was too complex for one generation – you can do it in pieces and join them. Keep in mind this is an evolving feature: early users noted some quirks, such as occasional unexpected cuts or loss of audio when exporting the combined scene. The safe bet is to still generate and download each shot individually, then do final joining in editing.

* **Maintaining Lighting and Color:** Scene Builder will generally carry over the environmental details (same time of day, same lighting) automatically since it knows it’s one scene. Still, it’s wise to mention any distinctive lighting in the first shot’s prompt so it propagates. For example: *“morning sunlight streams through the window”* in shot 1 prompt means shot 2 will likely also show morning sun on your character’s face. If you drastically change angles or the camera position, double-check that the lighting continuity still makes sense (the model might need a hint like “now from behind, the window light is a halo around her hair”). **Tip:** If the lighting or color tone shifts unexpectedly between shots, you may need to adjust the prompt or use editing to color-match later. Planning a **color grading progression** for the story (e.g. cooler tones early, warm tones later) should be done at the scene level, not mid-scene, so Scene Builder outputs remain consistent until you intentionally shift the look in a new scene.

* **When to start a New Scene:** Not all shots should be strung in one scene. If you are moving to a completely different location or time (say from a bedroom to an outdoor park), that’s a natural point to end one scene and start another fresh. You’ll then rely on your previously saved ingredients to keep the same characters in the new scene. Starting a new scene clears the immediate context, which can actually be helpful if the next scene has a very different mood or lighting – you wouldn’t want the indoor lighting to carry into an outdoor sunshine scene erroneously. So use Scene Builder for shots that logically belong together in time and place, and start a new scene (reset) when you transition the story. In our example project, we will have multiple scenes: e.g. Scene 1 might be the sickroom during Verse 1, Scene 2 the betrayal confrontation later, Scene 3 the performance on stage, etc., each possibly composed of a few shots via Scene Builder.

* **Limitations:** As of May 2025, Scene Builder is promising but not perfect. Sometimes the “character consistency” is good but not 100% – one report noted the character’s face and hair stayed the same but their clothing changed between shots. If you run into this, you can explicitly mention the outfit in the subsequent shot prompt (“she’s still wearing her blue cardigan from before”) or use a gentle touch in editing (maybe you won’t show the part of the frame that reveals the changed clothing if not critical). Also, be aware of audio handling: if you rely on AI-generated audio (like a line of dialogue in shot 1), combining it with shot 2 in Flow might drop one of the audios. A straightforward workaround is to **keep the AI audio only as a guide and overlay a separate audio track in post** (for dialogue, you could generate the audio separately or use a text-to-speech if needed, to have full control).

### 2.3 Visual Continuity and Style Consistency

Keeping the same actors from shot to shot is one part of continuity; the other is ensuring the whole piece feels like one coherent **visual style**. Here’s how to maintain continuity in lighting, color, props, and overall cinematography across your video:

* **Establish a Visual Language:** Decide on a cinematographic style for your project and apply it throughout. For example, you might choose *“natural light, handheld camera for intimate scenes, warm golden-hour tones for the finale”* as your guiding style. In our music video scenario, the **stylistic approach** was defined as: shallow depth of field, only natural/practical lighting (no fantastical lights), handheld for vignettes and smooth camera for performances. We want to mirror that in prompts. This means consistently using phrases like *“soft natural lighting”*, *“handheld feel”*, *“shallow depth of field (background blur)”* across all relevant prompts. Consistency in these phrases will guide Veo 3 to produce shots that look like they belong in the same film.

* **Lighting Continuity:** If your story progresses through different times of day or different moods, plan those shifts at scene boundaries. Within a scene, keep lighting constant. Across scenes, you might have a progression – e.g. start with *cool morning light*, move to *harsher midday shadows* for conflict, end in *warm golden hour* as a metaphor for resolution. You can implement this by explicitly prompting the lighting color and quality in each scene’s first shot: “cool bluish dawn light” in Scene 1, “neutral or gray overcast light” in a tense middle scene, “golden evening sun” in the climax, etc. Veo 3 responds well to these descriptive lighting cues. The result is a subtle color narrative threading through your video.

* **Recurring Motifs & Props:** If your story uses visual motifs (symbols that appear repeatedly), treat them as characters in terms of continuity. For instance, the **hands motif** (comforting hands, then betraying hands, then healing hands) means you’ll want multiple shots featuring hands in similar framing. You might choose to always describe these shots with a certain style, e.g. “close-up of hands in soft light” to unify them. The **window motif** (light through a window representing hope) could mean whenever a window is shown, you ensure the light has a consistent look (the same type of rays or lens flare). Using the same adjectives – “sunlight streams through a window” – each time will help Veo 3 repeat that effect. For the **cup prop**, we mentioned generating an image of it; when it appears in different scenes (whole vs. broken), keep its description consistent (“the handmade blue mug”). The final shot might explicitly reference it repaired on a windowsill – by that point the model should recall the mug’s color/shape from earlier prompts.

* **Performance vs. Narrative Footage:** In cases where you are intercutting between two types of footage (e.g. a performer on stage *versus* a narrative vignette), you actually might **want a stylistic contrast**, but it should be a *deliberate* one. For example, your performance scenes might always be shot with a stable gimbal camera and rich stage lighting, whereas the narrative scenes are handheld and gritty. Veo 3 can accommodate both styles, but be sure to signal clearly in prompts which style each shot should have. You essentially establish two sub-styles and stick to them within their contexts. This contrast can enhance the storytelling (the polished look of the singer on stage vs. the raw look of real life in the story), yet because you consistently apply each style to the right shots, the viewer won’t be jarred – they’ll perceive it as an artistic choice. In Section 5 we’ll discuss this performance/narrative intercut strategy more.

* **Frame Composition Continuity:** If you cut from a wide shot to a close-up in the same scene, obviously the framing changes – that’s normal. But ensure the spatial continuity: if the character was on the left in the wide shot, the close-up shouldn’t randomly show them on the right side facing the wrong way (180-degree rule type concerns). In AI generation, you can’t explicitly enforce film theory rules, but you can word your prompt to avoid confusion. For example, “shot from behind Alice’s shoulder looking toward Bob” sets a specific orientation. If the next shot is a reverse angle, you’d specify that (“now from over Bob’s shoulder looking back at Alice’s face”). Providing those details reduces the chance of the model giving you a weird angle that breaks spatial continuity. This is more of a manual consistency check – you as the director need to visualize how the shots will cut together and prompt accordingly. Veo 3’s improvement in understanding prompt context means it’s less likely to produce a totally off-the-mark camera angle if you’ve described it clearly.

In short, achieving visual continuity with Veo 3 involves **front-loading your decisions** about look and feel, and then being disciplined in your prompts. Reuse descriptive phrases for recurring elements, stick to the established style for each segment, and leverage the tool’s ingredient/scene memory where possible. Next, we’ll focus on the craft of **writing prompts** to get those cinematic shots, since a well-planned concept won’t shine unless you can translate it into effective text prompts for the AI.

## 3. Prompting Strategies for Cinematic Composition and Motion

Writing good prompts for Veo 3 is akin to writing mini-directorial instructions. You want to communicate the **who, what, where, and how** of the shot to the AI as clearly as possible, without overloading or confusing it. In this section, we break down prompt techniques for different cinematic elements: composition (framing, angle, depth of field), camera movement, and even sound instructions. We’ll also give example prompt snippets that you can adapt.

### 3.1 Describing the Scene and Framing

Start your prompt by setting the scene and the fundamental action, much like you would in a screenplay’s scene description, then add camera directives. Key tips:

* **Be Specific with Setting:** Always establish *where* the scene is and any important environmental details first. For example: *“Interior of a small hospital room, late afternoon sunlight coming through blinds.”* This gives context (inside, type of room, lighting mood) before introducing characters. Veo 3 will use this to render the background and overall tone.

* **Introduce Characters with Keywords:** When your character is in the shot, mention them right after setting. E.g.: *“Alice (the young caregiver) sits by a bed where an elderly woman lies resting.”* By naming or describing the character, you invoke the ingredient we set up (Alice) and tell the model who to show. If multiple characters are present, name them in order and use clear identifiers (instead of pronouns). For instance: *“Alice holds the elder’s hand”* is better than “She holds her hand” for the AI’s understanding.

* **Use Cinematic Adjectives:** Convey the **mood and visual style** with adjectives: *“hushed and intimate”, “dimly lit”, “rainy and cold”*, *“warm and inviting”*, etc. These help Veo 3 choose appropriate color and contrast. If you want a *realistic, cinematic* look, you can explicitly say *“in a cinematic style”* or reference *“35mm film look, soft focus background”*. However, avoid overly technical jargon that the model might not grasp; stick to common cinematography language and emotional tone words.

* **Frame and Angle**: Clearly state the desired shot type. Some useful terms:

  * *Wide shot / Establishing shot* – for showing full bodies and environment.
  * *Medium shot* – e.g. waist-up of a character.
  * *Close-up* – for faces or details (you can say “close-up of Alice’s face” or “tight shot of their hands clasped”).
  * *Point of view (POV)* – e.g. “POV of Alice peeking around the corner” will put the camera at Alice’s perspective.
  * *Over-the-shoulder* – mention if you want a perspective over a character’s shoulder, to situate the camera with respect to characters.
  * *Eye-level, low-angle, high-angle* – if relevant, mention the camera height. “Eye-level” gives a natural perspective, “low angle” might make a subject seem imposing, etc.
  * *Static or moving* – if the camera should not move, you can say “camera remains still” or “steady shot”. If it should move, we cover that in 3.2.

* **Depth of Field (Focus)**: If you want that professional look with background blur, include terms like *“shallow depth of field”* or *“background out of focus/bokeh”*. Veo 3 is good at this – e.g., *“the foreground hand is in focus while the background is softly blurred”* can yield an artistic focus effect. Conversely, if you need everything sharp (for a wide vista), you might specify *“deep focus landscape”*.

* **Example Prompt (Composition-focused):**

  ```text
  Interior of a humble bedroom in soft morning light. A wide shot shows Alice, in her blue cardigan, gently opening a window. The camera is stationary at eye-level, capturing Alice’s full form and the room around her. The atmosphere is quiet and reflective, with dust motes visible in the warm sunbeam.
  ```

  *What this does:* It sets location (interior bedroom, morning light), gives a wide framing with the character, specifies camera position (eye-level, stationary), and conveys mood (quiet, dust motes in sunbeam – a nice detail for realism). From this, Veo 3 should output a stable wide shot of Alice in that setting, with consistent lighting.

* **Avoiding Ambiguity:** Keep sentences straightforward and use punctuation to separate distinct ideas. Run-on sentences can confuse the model. It’s better to use one sentence per aspect: one for setting, one for action, one for camera instruction, one for ambience. The example above could even be broken into bullets in the Flow interface (Flow might have a multi-field prompt form, or you can just ensure each part of your description is clearly segmented). Also avoid pronouns like “he/she” without clear references – the model doesn’t have persistent memory of gender from previous sentences, so repeat the name or role if needed.

### 3.2 Directing Camera Movement and Motion

One of the joys of cinematic storytelling is using camera movement to enhance emotion – a slow push in can emphasize a dramatic realization, a shaky handheld pan can create anxiety, etc. With Veo 3, you can direct camera motion in the prompt, and it often pulls it off impressively. Some strategies:

* **Use Film Terminology for Moves:** Common camera moves and how to prompt them:

  * *Pan* – “the camera pans from left to right across the scene” (good for revealing new detail or following a character).
  * *Tilt* – “camera tilts down from the sky to reveal the character” (vertical movement).
  * *Dolly / Tracking shot* – “slow dolly in toward Alice as she begins to cry” (camera moving closer/into the scene) or “tracking shot following behind Alice as she walks” (camera moves with subject).
  * *Zoom* – “slow zoom in on the note in her hands” (though a zoom might be interpreted as camera move or just a cut – use sparingly; *dolly* gives more natural parallax).
  * *Handheld vs. Steadicam*: If you want a bit of natural shake, say “handheld camera style” – Veo 3 will introduce slight motion imperfections to simulate a person holding the camera. If you want it extremely smooth, say “steady cam” or simply don’t mention handheld (by default, many shots are fairly smooth unless told otherwise).
  * *Cut-ins*: If you want the generation itself to contain a cut (like two angles in one output – which is possible but unpredictable), you could describe it as: “First, the camera does X... then *cut to* Y angle.” However, note that giving multiple shots in one prompt may lead to the model actually splicing them (as happened inadvertently in one of the tests). It’s usually better to generate separate shots for separate angles (so you control the edit). We mention this because if you *do* see Veo 3 return a video with multiple cuts, it’s likely because your prompt read like a mini storyboard. To maintain control, stick to one camera motion per prompt and one continuous action.

* **Moving Subjects vs. Moving Camera:** Clarify what is moving in your scene. The model might confuse a “pan” with the character turning their head, etc., if not specific. For example: *“the camera follows behind Alice”* vs. *“Alice walks across the room”*. If both happen, split into two sentences: “Alice walks toward the door. The camera tracks behind her smoothly.” This way both motions are understood: Alice moves, and camera moves.

* **Speed of Motion:** Use descriptors like “slowly”, “quickly”, “suddenly” to influence the pacing. *“a slow, drifting pan”* versus *“a rapid handheld whip-pan”* yield different energy. Veo 3’s physics awareness means it will try to reflect those speeds.

* **Complex Moves:** If you want really complex moves (say a 360-degree turn around a character, or a crane shot rising up), you can certainly describe them: *“the camera circles around Alice 360°”* or *“camera rises upward to a bird’s-eye view”*. Be aware such ambitious moves might be hard to get perfect in one go, but experimentation can pay off. You might break it into two shots (half circle in one, then continue if needed with Scene Builder).

* **Example Prompt (Motion-focused):**

  ```text
  The camera starts tight on Alice’s hands clutching the mug, then slowly pulls back and upward (a gentle dolly-out) to reveal Alice and the elder in the room. This smooth upward motion gradually reveals the elder lying in bed and the sunlight on the floor. The shot is steady and graceful.
  ```

  *What this does:* It explicitly instructs a camera move: start close, pull back and up. It uses a parenthetical to clarify (dolly-out), describes the result of the move (revealing elder and sunlight), and emphasizes the motion quality (steady, graceful). Veo 3 would attempt to animate that continuous move within the clip. This is basically how you’d describe a cinematic reveal shot, and the model is capable of creating that sense of movement.

* **Check Results and Iterate:** After generation, review how the camera moved. If it didn’t do as expected, adjust wording. Perhaps “pull back” was understood but not “upward” – you might then try “pull back *and tilt up*” if the tilt didn’t happen. Or if it moved too fast, explicitly say “very slowly” or even “almost imperceptibly slow”. The nice thing with Veo 3 is you can iterate relatively quickly on these details since each clip is short.

* **Combining with Scene Builder:** If a desired camera move is too long or complex for one clip, use Scene Builder to break it. For instance, a continuous shot from outside a house, through the window, and into a close-up might be done in two generates: one approaching the window, then next continuing through it. You’d use a transitional prompt like “continue the previous motion through the window and toward Alice”. Flow’s continuous scene context should handle the alignment.

### 3.3 Prompting Sound and Dialogue

Audio is a new dimension for AI video, and prompting for sound in Veo 3 is a learning process. Here’s how to get (or not get) audio in your clips:

* **Background Ambience:** To include ambient sounds, simply mention them as part of the scene description. For example: *“A busy street with honking cars and chatter in the background”* will likely produce those sounds in the audio track. Or *“in the forest, birds are chirping”*. Veo 3 will generate an audio layer with those elements. Keep it plausible and relevant to the scene – it knows about common environmental sounds (wind, rain, crowd noise, etc.). If you want **no background audio** (maybe because you’ll add your own music later), it’s wise to state that: e.g. *“(scene is silent aside from a soft room tone)”* or *“no music, just quiet”*. Explicitly saying “Muted” or “silence” may help ensure the model doesn’t add something by default.

* **Music and Score:** Veo 3 can’t generate a full-fledged music score like a known song (it’s not a music model), but it might attempt generic music if you prompt it. For instance, *“a gentle piano plays in the background”* could cause soft piano audio. For a music video, you **do not** want the AI to make music – you have a real song for that. So make sure to instruct *no AI music*. In our example prompts, we often say “no music” because we plan to overlay the real track later. On the other hand, if you’re making, say, a silent short film and you want the AI to include a dramatic music cue, you can try prompting *“dramatic orchestral music swells”* – just be aware the quality will be limited and it may not sync perfectly to visuals.

* **Dialogue:** You can prompt characters to speak. The safest way is to include the dialogue line in quotes in your prompt and describe the manner of speaking. For example: *“Alice whispers, ‘I’m here with you.’”* This would prompt Veo 3 to animate Alice’s mouth and output a whispering voice audio saying that line (in some AI-generated voice). Similarly: *“The elder weakly says, ‘Thank you.’”* should produce that line spoken. The lip-sync capabilities are touted as accurate, meaning if the line is delivered, the character’s mouth movement will match the audio quite well. A few caveats:

  * The voices are AI-generated and may sound somewhat generic or robotic. They are not specific voice actors. For brief lines and background chatter, they can be convincing enough. For heavy dialogue scenes, if you need high quality, you might replace the audio later with your own recording but still use the AI’s lip-sync as a reference.
  * Avoid giving very long monologues in one prompt; the model might not faithfully speak multi-sentence speeches, and it could garble or shorten them. One line at a time works best.
  * Use emotional descriptors: *“in a trembling voice she says, ‘...’”* can influence the tone of delivery. Veo 3’s audio is not as finely controllable as a dedicated text-to-speech engine, but it might reflect basic cues (whispered, shouted, etc., if clearly indicated).

* **Lip Sync without Audio:** If you want the character to appear to sing or talk but plan to overlay real audio (common in music videos), you can prompt something like: *“The singer mouths the words passionately (audio not needed from AI)”*. The model might still generate some audio (it might fill in a dummy singing voice), but you can ignore or mute it. The important part is the visual – that the singer’s performance looks like singing. You might include some lyrics in the prompt to guide mouth shapes, but that can be risky (the AI might try to sing them). Another approach: use a generic line like *“la la la”* or just say *“(singer is singing energetically)”* without specific lyrics. The AI will animate the mouth and perhaps make a vocalization that you’ll replace anyway. In editing, you’ll align the real song to the singer’s mouth movements as best as possible (it won’t be perfect lip-sync, but with creative camera angles and cutaways on tricky parts, you can sell it).

* **Audio Post-processing Tips:** Flow allows you to download the video and audio tracks. In your video editor, you can decide how to mix them. For our music video, we’ll mostly use the real song as the audio, but we might keep some AI-generated ambience at low volume in narrative scenes (e.g. a bit of room noise or a door creak, to maintain realism). If the AI produced dialogue lines we want, those can be kept, or re-recorded by voice actors for higher quality while keeping the timing.

* **Example Prompt (with audio cues):**

  ```text
  Alice gently lays a hand on the elder’s forehead. “You’re going to be alright,” she whispers softly. In the background, a heart monitor beeps steadily and the air conditioner hums. No music, just these subtle hospital sounds.
  ```

  In this prompt, the quote indicates dialogue for Alice (whispering a line). We also explicitly mention the ambient sounds (monitor beep, AC hum) and said no music. The resulting clip should have Alice’s lips saying *“You’re going to be alright”* in a soft voice, and a faint beeping and humming in the audio. This kind of realism in audio elevates the scene’s immersion.

* **Troubleshooting Audio Prompts:** If a certain sound doesn’t come through, consider if it’s too unusual. Veo 3 knows common sounds; very specific or rare sounds might be missed. Also, avoid text that looks like instructions to the user (e.g. don’t write `[sound: birds chirping]` – the model might ignore bracketed stuff). Just describe it naturally. If you get unwanted audio (like the model put in some stock music), emphasize “no music” more strongly or remove any words that could imply music (even the word “song” or “singer” might accidentally trigger it to add singing – so sometimes we say “vocalist performing silently” to be safe in visuals).

With these prompting techniques, you essentially become the director and cinematographer through words. Next, we’ll address how to plan all this prompting activity efficiently so you don’t run out of credits – basically, how to approach the workflow with a **budget-aware mindset** and make the most of Veo 3’s power.

## 4. Budget-Aware Workflow and Efficiency Tips

Creating a multi-clip narrative with AI can consume a lot of generation credits, so it’s important to be strategic. Here are some tips to manage your budget (and time) while using Veo 3:

* **Plan First, Generate Smart:** The more clarity you have in your plan (script, storyboards, shot list), the fewer random trial-and-error generations you’ll need. Before you hit “Generate,” know what you want from that shot. It helps to write out a rough prompt for each planned clip in plain text as part of your script breakdown. Think of it like planning your filming schedule – it reduces on-set (or in this case, in-app) improvisation which can waste resources. If you have a detailed blueprint (like the one we’ll use in our example), leverage it to guide each prompt.

* **Use Test Runs (Low-Stakes Drafts):** If you’re unsure how a certain idea will turn out, do a quick **draft generation**. Options for this:

  * Use a shorter prompt or simpler version first. For example, before generating a complex 10-second scene with multiple elements, try a 3-second snippet of the most crucial part to see if the style is right.
  * Use **Veo 2** for drafts if available. Flow might allow you to switch the model to Veo 2 (which might use fewer credits or be more abundant in the Pro plan) for testing. Veo 2’s quality is lower, but it can give a general sense of composition and content. *Important:* as of launch, some advanced features (Ingredients to Video, Frames to Video) default to using Veo 2. If you exploit those for drafts (e.g. testing an ingredient layout), be aware the final quality with Veo 3 will be higher, so don’t be discouraged by a rough Veo 2 preview – it will only get better.
  * Lower resolution or quality settings: Flow might not expose resolution control, but if it does (e.g. a “preview mode”), use it for drafts. Shorter duration (like generating 5 seconds instead of 10) is another way to preview an idea with half the cost.

* **One Generation at a Time:** Each Veo 3 generation costs \~150 credits regardless of outcome. Resist the urge to queue up multiple variations at once. Instead, generate one clip, evaluate it, and decide if you actually need to change something. Often a generation might come out perfect or at least usable on first try, and you can move on, saving credits. If it’s not right, identify specifically what to tweak in the prompt rather than regenerating blindly. Maybe the lighting was off – so adjust that in the prompt and try again, instead of hoping a second attempt with the same prompt will randomly be better.

* **Iterate with Purpose:** When you do need multiple tries, tweak deliberately:

  * Change or remove one element at a time. If you had 3 adjectives and you suspect one caused weirdness, drop it or swap it and regenerate.
  * If the character’s face came out wrong, consider using a reference image if you haven’t, or simplifying the description of the face (sometimes too many details can confuse the model).
  * Use **negative prompts** if supported. Flow might have an interface for “things to avoid.” For example, if the model kept inserting text on screen or a watermark, you could put “no text overlay, no subtitles” in a negative or avoid-field. (If no explicit feature, just include “Do not include any on-screen text or captions” in your prompt, as we did in some examples.)

* **Reuse and Recycle:** If a generation yields a clip where *part* of it is perfect and another part is not, you might be able to salvage it in editing rather than regenerate. For instance, suppose you generated a 8-second clip: the first 5 seconds are exactly what you need, but the last 3 seconds the character’s face warps. You can decide to only use the good portion (cutting before the glitch) and maybe fill the gap with another shot or B-roll. This way you don’t spend another 150 credits trying to fix something that you can simply exclude. Similarly, if the video looks great but the AI audio has a glitch, you don’t need to regenerate the video – just mute or replace the audio track (cost = 0 credits).

* **Consider Multi-Purpose Shots:** Sometimes one clip can serve multiple purposes with clever editing. For example, a single wide shot that lasts 10 seconds might contain several framings within it (you could punch in and crop to make a fake close-up in post, or use the beginning as one shot and the end as another). This is like shooting coverage in film – one take can give you a wide and you can digitally zoom for a medium shot if resolution allows. Because Veo 3’s quality is fairly high, you might be able to get away with cropping in a bit. However, note that the resolution isn’t likely beyond HD, so extreme zooms will lose quality. Still, it’s worth remembering you can sometimes **extract still frames** or segments from a clip and reuse them. For example, a dramatic close-up frame could be exported as a still image for a thumbnail or for extending a moment in editing.

* **Stay Organized:** As you generate dozens of clips, keep them organized (Flow’s asset management feature can help). Name your clips or download them with clear filenames indicating their scene/shot. This will prevent accidental duplicate generations because you lost track of a file. It also helps you make sure you didn’t forget to generate a needed transition shot or missing piece (which could cost time later).

* **Monitor Credit Spend:** Flow likely shows your remaining credits. Keep an eye on it, especially if you’re doing a large project. If you find yourself running low in the middle of a project, you might prioritize which remaining shots are truly essential. It’s better to have a complete story with a few compromise shots than an incomplete film. You can also decide to simplify some shots to save credits (e.g. maybe you planned two separate clips for two cutaway details – instead, combine them into one clip with a quick pan if possible, covering both details in one generation). On the flip side, if you have plenty of credits left near the end, you can indulge in some extra “alternative takes” or bonus shots for flexibility in editing.

* **Cost vs. Quality Trade-offs:** At launch, using Veo 3 is tied to the Ultra subscription and higher credit cost. If you have access to Veo 2 (which might be cheaper per gen or unlimited on a lower plan), you might wonder if you should use Veo 2 for some final shots. Generally, for the **hero shots** of your project (key moments, faces of main characters, anything in focus), you’ll want the best quality – stick to Veo 3. For very quick flashes or abstract shots (like a half-second cutaway of trees or a fast motion blur transition), Veo 2 might suffice if you’re desperate to save credits, but the consistency could suffer. In most cases, you’ll use Veo 3 for all final outputs in a serious cinematic project. Think of Veo 2 as the “storyboard sketch” and Veo 3 as the “final camera”.

In summary, be **deliberate and efficient**. Many of these tips mirror real film production common sense – plan ahead, get coverage, and don’t waste resources on what you don’t need. With these practices, even a complex multi-clip video can be generated on a limited budget of credits.

Next, let’s explore some prime **use cases** for Veo 3, including the one we’re focusing on: a music video with intercut narrative, which will lead into our full walkthrough example.

## 5. Use Cases Where Veo 3 Excels

Veo 3’s unique blend of video and audio generation plus continuity features makes it well-suited for certain types of projects. Below we highlight a few, including tips specific to each:

### 5.1 Music Videos (Performance + Story)

**Why Veo 3 is great for this:** Music videos often interweave a performing artist singing with narrative or abstract sequences. Veo 3 can handle the *performance* aspect by generating your singer singing (with lip-sync) on various “virtual sets,” **and** handle the *narrative vignettes* with consistent actors and cinematic quality. The addition of audio means even if you mute the AI audio in favor of the actual song, the singer’s performance looks authentic (their mouth moves to lyrics, etc.).

**Tips for Music Videos:**

* **Synchronize Atmosphere with Music:** Even though Veo 3 won’t generate the actual song, you prompt visuals that match the song’s mood and tempo. For an upbeat part, describe more energetic camera moves and brighter visuals; for a slow bridge, go for gentle movements and softer lighting. This way, when you later cut to the real music, the imagery feels inherently in sync with it.
* **Performance Shots:** Decide how you want to portray the singer or band. Are they performing on a stage, in a studio, outdoors? Prompt accordingly with consistent location and lighting each time you show them performing so that those shots all look like the same performance session. For example, always mention *“in a dim studio with golden backlighting”* if that’s the look. Since the singer likely appears multiple times through the video, ensure their outfit and instrument (if any) are consistent – you may generate a reference image of the singer on stage first as a guide.
* **Narrative Shots:** You can treat the narrative sections like a short film intercut with the performance. Use all the continuity tricks from Section 2 to maintain the story’s characters. One approach is to have **one protagonist** in the narrative that goes through a journey (which could mirror the song’s emotions). In our example, that’s the young caregiver who faces betrayal and finds peace. Having one main narrative character creates a strong link between disparate scenes (the same person is in all of them), and Veo 3 can keep that person’s appearance consistent scene to scene.
* **Intercutting Strategy:** Plan where you’ll cut between performance and narrative. For instance, maybe each verse is narrative, and each chorus cuts back to the band. Veo 3 doesn’t know the music structure, but you do. So you might generate full narrative sequences for verses and full performance sequences for choruses, then later slice them together on the beat. To make the transitions smooth, you can create **bridging shots**: e.g. a shot where the singer’s scene and narrative scene share a visual element or composition. Perhaps during an instrumental break, you show a wide shot of the band that morphs into a scene with the main character in a similar pose (you can achieve this by matching framing and then crossfading in editing). While AI won’t do that match cut automatically, you can prompt two shots to be visually analogous (like both have a window in the same position on screen, etc.). It’s a creative editing trick backed by thoughtful prompting.
* **Story Symbolism:** Music videos love symbolism. Veo 3 can create very poetic visuals (e.g., a lone flower growing through concrete, hands releasing a bird, etc.) to intersperse literal story moments. Use its strength in realism or dream-like imagery to your advantage. For example, if the song’s theme is *redemption*, maybe include a recurring symbol of *light* (we have that in windows and sunrise in our example). You can ask for a specific symbolic shot like “fabric gently blowing in sunlight” for a calming effect – something that might be B-roll in a live-action production, you can generate as needed.
* **Lip-Sync Consideration:** If showing the singer closely, try to generate them actually singing some of the key lyrics using the methods in 3.3. If the lips don’t match your real song perfectly, plan your cuts to not linger too long on tight shots. Many music videos cut rapidly for this reason. Use more instrumental sections for close-ups (because then precise sync is less an issue – no lyrics at that moment, just emotion on face). Use chorus wide shots where maybe exact lip detail isn’t visible but energy is high.
* **Performance Audio:** If your music video has moments where the performance audio can come through (e.g., the singer begins the song alone, and you might want their raw voice before the track kicks in), Veo 3 could provide that dry vocal. However, an AI-sung vocal to match a real singer’s voice is a long shot. Another tactic: you could feed an actual acapella of the singer if Flow eventually allows audio input (currently, it doesn’t). For now, you’d likely rely on post-editing for any actual performance audio.

### 5.2 Narrative Shorts (Story Scenes with Dialogue)

**Why Veo 3 is great:** It enables one or two characters in a scene to speak lines, move around, and for you to shoot it cinematically without a crew. You can create emotionally rich scenes – from intimate dramas to small action sequences – with consistent actors and even have them talk to each other.

**Tips:**

* **Dialogue-driven Scenes:** Write out the dialogue as part of your prompt (or plan to dub it later). For each shot, decide whose perspective or whose reaction you want. You might generate multiple angles of the same conversation (like an **AI shot-reverse-shot**). For instance, generate a medium shot of Character A delivering a line, then another of Character B reacting. Because Veo 3 doesn’t have memory across separate generations unless you use Scene Builder, it might be easier to use Scene Builder for a dialogue exchange: e.g., prompt Shot 1 with Character A’s line, then Add Shot with Character B’s response. The continuity should hold (room, positions, etc.). You’ll get two clips which you can intercut just like filmed coverage.
* **Emoting and Body Language:** Don’t hesitate to describe facial expressions and body language. *“Tears in her eyes”, “he folds his arms defensively”, “she smiles sadly”*. Veo 3 is quite adept at reflecting these in the animation. It’s also good at subtle motions (shrugs, nods) if you mention them. This adds realism to dialogue scenes which otherwise could feel static.
* **Action and Stunts:** Simple action (a character walking, running, picking up objects) is very doable. Complex stunts (a fight scene, a character driving a car in a chase, etc.) push the limits. They might require breaking into many short shots (which is true of real film too) – you could generate a punch being thrown in one 2-second clip, the other person’s reaction in another, etc. Veo 3’s understanding of physics helps (it was noted to excel at physical consistency). Still, for narrative shorts, lean into drama and emotion, which is its strong suit, rather than huge CGI spectacle.
* **Genre and Style:** You can aim for various genres: a horror short with flickering lights and whispers (Veo 3 will output spooky audio and visuals), or a comedy sketch with bright lighting and maybe exaggerated motions. The key is adjusting your prompts to the style conventions (e.g., for horror: “shadows, tense silence, sudden creak sound”; for comedy: “bright, upbeat tone, quick zoom on funny reaction” etc.). Veo 3 will follow your lead on style surprisingly well.

### 5.3 Performance/Narrative Intercut (beyond music)

This category includes scenarios like **documentary-style videos** (intercutting an interview with illustrative footage), **speeches or poetry** with visual metaphors, or even **educational videos** with a presenter on screen and cutaways.

* **Interview/Documentary:** Suppose you have an AI-generated person acting as an “interview subject” talking about something, and you cut to scenes of what they describe. Veo 3 can generate the talking head with synced speech, and also generate the B-roll scenes. Ensure the interviewee’s shots have a consistent setting (same background, camera angle each time they appear, for continuity like a real interview). The narrative cutaways can then be a different style. This is very similar to the music video structure but with speech instead of song. Veo 3’s advantage: you can create a pseudo-documentary even without any real footage.
* **Poetry or Spoken Word:** If you have a narration (maybe you’ll record a voiceover externally), you can have Veo 3 create visuals that complement it. Sometimes a narrator could be on camera (like a poet performing their piece) – handle that like the singer in a music video. Or the narrator is off-camera, and you just generate the scenes described in the voiceover. Veo 3’s capacity for beautiful imagery (remember, it’s built from Google’s image generation expertise) means you can get very creative, abstract visuals to match a poem’s mood.
* **Live Performance with Visualization:** Imagine a dancer was recorded on stage and you want to add AI-generated visuals around them. While mixing real footage with Veo 3 output is tricky (you can’t easily insert AI elements into real video yet via Flow), you can generate a full video of a dancer and stylize the environment. Or if you have a real performer on green screen, you could generate backgrounds with Veo to composite. These are advanced techniques outside Flow’s direct scope, but as a use case, Veo 3 could supply the scenic design for stage performances, etc.

In all these cases, the general advice is: **keep each thread consistent internally** (presenter shots all look alike, narrative sequences use recurring characters or motifs) and use editing to merge them into a coherent whole.

Now that we’ve covered the theory and strategies, let’s put it all together. In the next section, we’ll walk through a **complete example**: producing a music video step-by-step using Google Veo 3, applying everything we’ve discussed – from planning and prompting to final editing.

## 6. Walkthrough Example: Producing *“The Interwoven Path”* Music Video

*(In this section, we’ll create a fictitious music video project from scratch using Veo 3. The project is based on an example script with themes of compassion, betrayal, and redemption – drawn from the provided lyrics and video blueprint. We’ll illustrate how to plan scenes, generate each shot with prompts, and assemble the final video.)*

**Project Overview:** *“The Interwoven Path”* is a song with a narrative music video about a young caregiver who helps others, is betrayed by a close friend, and ultimately finds peace and healing. The video intercuts between the **singer’s performance** and **story vignettes** depicting acts of compassion and the protagonist’s journey. Visual motifs of hands, windows, a broken cup, and evolving light tie the story together. The tone moves from warm and gentle to sorrowful and fractured, and finally to uplifting and radiant.

### 6.1 Pre-Production: Planning and Asset Creation

**a. Analyze the Script and Blueprint:** We have the lyrics broken down by timecode (from *ps\_script.txt*) and a detailed scene-by-scene outline (from *ps\_script\_video.txt*). Key sections are:

* **Intro (00:00–00:15):** Instrumental – visual calm before story begins. Singer at piano in morning light.
* **Verse 1 (00:15–00:58):** Theme of caring for the weak – main vignette of caregiver tending an elderly person in bed; possibly another vignette (woman crying, someone comforts her). Singer sings intimately.
* **Instrumental Break (01:02–01:16):** Abstract shots (dust in light, candle flicker) and band wide shots to set tone.
* **Verse 2 (01:16–01:49):** Theme of enemies and whispering – protagonist sees colleagues/friends whispering (gossip) about them. Singer’s intensity increases, making eye contact with camera.
* **Chorus 1 (01:49–02:28):** Uplifting “Woah-oh” refrain – band playing fully; vignettes show small positive moments (elder smiles, a hopeful note).
* **Verse 3 (02:35–03:00):** Deep betrayal – the caregiver protagonist discovers a friend’s betrayal (finds room empty, friend backstabbing, cup drops and shatters). This is the emotional low point. Also a special shot on singer’s mouth during a “plosive” lyric for dramatic effect.
* **Bridge (03:00–03:33):** Lyrics “But You, O Lord…” – protagonist at their lowest, then turning point. We show them picking up a piece of the broken cup, light warming up. Singer’s expression softens.
* **Chorus 2 (03:36–04:08):** Reprise – resolution – band in golden light; narrative: previously separated people reconnect (a knock on the door and reunion hug).
* **Outro (04:08–04:29 instrumental, 04:37–05:12 final chorus):** Visual montage of liberation – e.g. protagonist walking into morning sunlight, nature shots (hands outstretched, sun through trees, fabric in wind) leading to final scene. Final scene: singer ends alone on stage; protagonist lights a candle and smiles as sunlight hits their face; camera lingers on the once-broken mug now repaired on a windowsill. Fade out.

From this, we identify **key characters**:

* The *Singer* (an indie folk singer, male, late 20s, with a warm presence).
* The *Protagonist/Caregiver* (female, mid-20s, kind-looking) – our “unifying protagonist” across vignettes.
* The *Elderly Person* (could be a grandparent figure cared for in Verse 1).
* The *Friend/Betrayer* (perhaps similar age to protagonist, who betrays her trust).
* Possibly minor characters: e.g. a person who comforts the crying woman (if we include that vignette), background whisperers, etc. These we might not need to design deeply – they can be generic or even implied off-screen.

We also note **visual motifs** to incorporate:

* *Hands:* many shots of hands – comforting, then a hand betraying (heel lifted against me), then forgiving hand on shoulder etc.. We will include some close-ups of hands at pivotal moments.
* *Windows and Light:* windows appear in the caregiver’s scenes (light shining through as hope) and specifically a final window shot with the repaired mug. We plan light progression: morning light (hope) → shadowy midstory → golden hour reconciliation → bright sunlight at end.
* *Cup/Mug:* a shared cup of soup in Verse 1, the same cup dropping and breaking in Verse 3, and the repaired cup in the final scene.
* *Color palette:* as per blueprint: start with soft cool tones, desaturate during betrayal, end in warm glow. We’ll keep this in mind while prompting lighting.

**b. Create Character Ingredients (Portraits):** Using Flow’s image generation:

* *Singer:* We generate a portrait: “Professional portrait of an indie folk singer, 28 years old, with wavy dark hair and expressive eyes, wearing a simple black T-shirt. Soft studio lighting on face, neutral background.” This gives us the singer’s face and vibe. Suppose the result is a kindly looking man with shoulder-length wavy hair – we accept that and save it as **Singer**.

* *Protagonist (Caregiver):* Prompt: “Portrait of a compassionate young adult woman, 24 years old, light brown hair in a loose ponytail, gentle facial features, wearing a cozy cardigan. Soft daylight on her face, warm background.” Save this as **Protagonist**. We get an image we’re happy with (perhaps reminiscent of the description from Gen-4 guide).

* *Elder:* If the elder appears on camera, create a portrait: “Portrait of a kindly elderly woman in her 80s, frail but smiling softly, gray hair, lying on a pillow. Diffuse indoor lighting.” Save as **Elder**.

* *Friend/Betrayer:* “Portrait of a young woman, 25, friendly face but with a hint of mischief, short dark hair. Casual attire.” Save as **Friend**. (Or make it a young man, if we want a male betrayer – script is ambiguous. Let’s assume female friend for now.)

* *Check consistency:* We now have a “cast.” We might generate a quick **group photo** or a test image of the caregiver and friend together, just to see if they look distinct and recognizable next to each other. If not perfect, that’s okay – their roles will be clear in context. The main thing is our protagonist’s look is set in our mind and saved.

* *Prop and environment references:* We create a quick image of the **mug**: “Blue ceramic mug on a wooden table, simple design.” (This matches what we want.) Save that image for reference. Also, an image of the **bedroom sickroom**: “Cozy small bedroom with morning sunlight through a window, a bed with white sheets.” Save it to guide initial scene lighting.

Now we have ingredients and references ready to use in prompts.

**c. Outline Scenes and Shots:** We break the video into a sequence of scenes and plan 1–3 shots for each, noting which characters and angles. For brevity, here’s a summary:

* **Scene 1: Intro Performance (0:00–0:15)** – Singer at piano in a sunlit studio. *Shot 1:* Side angle of singer’s hands on piano keys, morning light through window (establish mood). *Shot 2:* Slow push-in on singer’s face as he closes eyes, feeling the music.
* **Scene 2: Caregiving Vignette (Verse 1, 0:15–0:58)** – Protagonist with Elder.

  * *Shot 1:* Wide shot: Protagonist sits at elder’s bedside in soft morning light (compassionate atmosphere).
  * *Shot 2:* Close-up on hands: Protagonist holding elder’s hand (motif).
  * *Shot 3:* (Optional cutaway) Another person crying in a stairwell vignette: if included, a shot of that scenario – but maybe we skip to focus on main storyline to save credits.
  * Singer cutaways: Intercut *Scene 1* singer shots here (the singer’s intimate shots overlay parts of Verse 1, as if he’s singing directly to this situation).
* **Scene 3: Whispering (Verse 2, 1:16–1:49)** – Protagonist experiences ostracism.

  * *Shot 1:* Medium: Protagonist in a hallway at work/church, sees two friends (including Betrayer friend) whispering while glancing at her.
  * *Shot 2:* POV from protagonist’s perspective: seeing the friends turning away, perhaps catching “poison eyes” looking at her. This conveys her isolation.
  * Singer in this section: We plan a *Singer* shot looking into camera intensely (to be generated in Scene 1 context: e.g., singer stepping forward reaching out to camera).
* **Scene 4: Chorus Uplift (1:49–2:28)** – Montage of hopeful moments.

  * *Shot 1:* Band performance full shot: wide of singer with band in warm light, all playing passionately.
  * *Shot 2:* Elderly person smiles faintly in bed (perhaps protagonist by her side).
  * *Shot 3:* Protagonist finds a note or sees a small act of kindness – maybe reading a supportive text message (hope glimmers).
  * These will be intercut rapidly to the “Woah-oh” refrain. We ensure all are lit a bit warmer than before, signaling things might turn better.
* **Scene 5: Betrayal (Verse 3, 2:35–3:00)** – Climax of conflict.

  * *Shot 1:* Protagonist comes to meet Friend but finds an empty room (the friend left). Perhaps a plate of food left untouched indicating she was caring for them but they bailed.
  * *Shot 2:* She then *sees the Friend speaking ill of her behind her back* just outside or in another room. A shot of Friend gossiping with others, casting a glance at protagonist. (This might be without dialogue or with a muffled audio of a nasty remark – but lyric says “lifted his heel against me” meaning betrayal).
  * *Shot 3:* **Cup drop shot:** The protagonist is holding that familiar mug (maybe she brought it for the friend) and in shock she drops it. We need a slow-motion shot of the **blue mug falling and shattering on the ground**. This is a key visual metaphor. We’ll generate this as a separate shot with focus on the mug.
  * *Special Singer shot:* On the lyric with a plosive (“A curse is poured…”), blueprint suggests a tight shot of singer’s mouth catching the breath. We will generate a short close-up of the singer’s mouth at mic, possibly with a quick camera jolt to simulate the plosive impact.
* **Scene 6: Turning Point (3:00–3:33)** – “But You, O Lord...” (prayer and mercy).

  * *Shot 1:* Aftermath of betrayal – Protagonist kneels down, picking up pieces of the broken cup on the floor. Lighting starts to shift warmer (dawn of hope).
  * *Shot 2:* She holds a piece of the cup, maybe a tear rolls down, and light rays begin to illuminate her. A symbolic shot of mercy entering (could even have a subtle glow).
  * Singer’s expression now softer, empathetic – possibly cut to singer with a gentle look (we might reuse a performance close-up or generate a new one).
* **Scene 7: Chorus Reprise (3:36–4:08)** – Resolution.

  * *Shot 1:* Singer and band in “golden hour” performance – a beautiful, fully lit stage or outdoor performance in sunset light.
  * *Shot 2:* Protagonist stands at home as **Friend arrives at her door**, maybe looking remorseful. Without words, they share a moment of forgiveness (the friend maybe in tears, protagonist offers a hug).
  * *Shot 3:* They hug with relief (hands motif: we see hands embracing). Light of sunset through window on them.
* **Scene 8: Outro (4:08–5:12)** – Visual poetry and final closure.

  * *Shot 1:* (4:08–4:29 instrumental) A series of nature/abstract shots symbolizing liberation:

    * e.g. *Hands outstretched against sunlight*,
    * *sun rays through trees*,
    * *a piece of white fabric catching the breeze*.
    * We can generate these as one or two clips and cut into pieces.
  * *Shot 2:* Final chorus lines (4:37–5:12) focusing on protagonist and singer:

    * Protagonist now in a new morning, **lighting a candle by the window** and looking peaceful.
    * As piano ends, we see the **repaired blue mug on the windowsill catching sunlight** (the final image motif).
    * Singer’s final shot: perhaps he finishes the song, alone on stage, lights dim except a spotlight. A gentle smile or a look upward, and fade out on that and the window. We’ll likely use crossfade between singer and the window with mug.

This is a lot of shots (indeed a full music video is complex!). In practice, one might trim or merge some to fit the budget. For demonstration, we won’t generate absolutely every single one, but we’ll walk through representative ones to show the workflow.

### 6.2 Generation Phase: Executing with Veo 3

Now we go scene by scene, writing prompts and noting how we use our ingredients and prompting techniques.

**Scene 1 – Singer Performance Intro:**
*(We want the singer in a sunlit loft-like studio playing piano.)*

* *Shot 1 (piano keys close-up)* – We won’t over-describe since it’s a simple cut-in shot:

  * **Prompt:** *“Morning light streams through a loft window onto a piano. Close-up on the singer’s hands gently playing the piano keys (only hands and keyboard visible). The room is quiet and dust motes float in the sunbeam. Warm, golden morning tone. (No music yet, just soft ambient room sound).”*
  * We reference the singer ingredient subtly by saying “singer’s hands” – Flow should understand it’s the Singer’s hands, but since it’s just hands it may not matter. We emphasize lighting and silence. Veo 3 will produce a 5-second clip: likely static shot of hands on keys with nice light. We’ll get some piano note sounds maybe since he’s playing (if we didn’t want that, we could say “sound of gentle piano notes” actually might be okay as the intro, but since the actual song has a muted piano intro, maybe we do want it – could sync surprisingly well if tempo is similar).
  * We generate and get a clip – check: hands look male, lighting nice. Great. Save it as “Singer\_piano\_intro.mp4”.

* *Shot 2 (singer face shot)* – We want an emotional close-up to cut to:

  * **Prompt:** *“Now a medium close-up of the singer’s face as he sings softly. The singer (the same man from before) is bathed in soft morning light from the side. Camera is steady, focusing on his expression – eyes closed, voice soulful. ‘(humming tune)’ he hums gently. No background music, just a faint natural reverb of the room.”*
  * We explicitly say “same man from before” to enforce using the Singer ingredient. We direct the expression and even put a placeholder humming to encourage a bit of gentle vocal audio (which we might lower under the actual track later). This is done in Scene Builder after Shot 1, to carry continuity (the room lighting, etc., stays the same).
  * The output: a 5-10s clip of the singer’s face singing/humming, nice lighting. We’ll likely use segments of this throughout Verse 1 for cutaways. Save as “Singer\_close\_intro.mp4”.

**Scene 2 – Caregiver & Elder (Verse 1):**
*(We switch to narrative: the caregiver in the bedroom with the elder.)*

* *Scene 2, Shot 1: Wide bedside shot* – Set up the environment and characters.

  * **Prompt:** *“Interior of a small bedroom in morning light. The **Protagonist** (young woman with brown ponytail) sits on a chair by the bed, where the **Elder** (an frail 80-year-old woman) lies. The protagonist gently feeds the elder some soup from a mug, caring and attentive. Camera is in a wide shot, capturing both of them and the soft light coming through a window. The atmosphere is warm and tender. No music, just the quiet sound of a spoon in the cup and a faint bird chirp from outside.”*
  * We capitalized **Protagonist** and **Elder** to signal those ingredients. The prompt paints the whole compassionate scene. We include the mug of soup (important prop) being used. Sounds: spoon in cup clink, bird chirp to emphasize peaceful morning.
  * Generate as a new scene (since it’s separate locale from Scene 1). The output: likely a lovely scene. We check that the protagonist looks like the reference (brown ponytail etc.). If her clothes aren’t what we want (say the model changed her outfit), we might prompt next shot or re-run specifying “wearing the same cozy cardigan as before” (even though we never showed her before in video, the reference image had it).
  * Save as “Caregiver\_wide.mp4”.

* *Shot 2: Close-up on hands (motif)* – Use Scene Builder to add a shot in same scene:

  * **Prompt:** *“Cut to a close-up: The elder’s frail hand rests on the protagonist’s hand on the bed covers. The young woman’s hand gently squeezes the elder’s. Focus on their hands in the warm light. The room is quiet except for the tick of a clock. (No dialogue)”*
  * This uses context so it knows which hand is whose. The lighting and setting carry over. This should give a touching shot of hands together.
  * Save as “Caregiver\_hands.mp4”.

*(We might also generate a medium shot of the protagonist’s face smiling at the elder, if needed for editing variety. But let’s keep two for now.)*

* *Alternate vignette (optional): Crying woman* – If we include it:

  * **Prompt:** *“In a dim stairwell corner, a young woman sits crying quietly. Another person walks over and sits beside her, offering a tissue without a word. Camera handheld, medium shot. The sound of soft sobbing and a gentle sniffle echo in the stairwell.”*
  * This would be a one-off shot representing another act of compassion. We did not predefine these people as ingredients, but that’s okay – they appear just once. This will be used as a quick insert if at all.
  * Save as “Stairwell\_comfort.mp4”.

*(During Verse 1, we would intercut Singer shots from Scene 1 and these Scene 2 shots. For example, start with the wide bedside, cut to singer close-up on a lyric line, cut to hands close-up on a lyric about “He guards their life” maybe, back to singer, maybe a glimpse of the stairwell scene if using, etc. That editing comes later.)*

**Scene 3 – Whispering (Verse 2):**
*(Protagonist faces betrayal foreshadowing.)*

* *Scene 3, Shot 1: Hallway whisper* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Interior, daytime, at the entrance of an office. The **Protagonist** stands a few steps away, watching as two friends whisper to each other while glancing at her. One of them is her close friend (the **Friend**, short dark hair). The friends stop talking when they notice her. Camera perspective is slightly behind the protagonist’s shoulder, focusing on the friends’ furtive looks. The lighting is cooler, a bit shadowy, reflecting the chill of gossip. We hear faint murmuring but can’t make out words.”*
  * We use Protagonist and Friend ingredients. The over-the-shoulder framing (Protagonist’s shoulder visible) and friend glancing should convey she’s being talked about. We requested cooler lighting (the tone darkens here).
  * Save “Whisper\_scene.mp4”.

* *Shot 2: Protagonist reaction* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Now a close-up on the Protagonist’s face as she realizes they’ve been talking about her. Her expression falls, hurt. In the background, we see the two friends quickly dispersing. The camera is steady on her face, emphasizing her isolation. The only sound is a slight echo of the hallway – the whispering has stopped.”*
  * Scene Builder from shot 1 ensures same setting. This gives an emotional reaction shot.
  * Save “Protagonist\_reaction.mp4”.

*(We will also incorporate a performance shot of the singer making eye contact to bridge Verse 2 to chorus as per blueprint. Perhaps we reuse or generate a new Singer shot: maybe Singer now looking into camera with more intensity – we can generate that in Scene 1 by a new shot: “Singer steps forward and sings passionately, looking into the lens” etc. Save as needed.)*

**Scene 4 – First Chorus (Woah-oh):**
*(A mix of performance and hopeful vignettes.)*

* *Shot 1: Full band performance wide* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Now a wide shot of the singer on stage with his band, performing the chorus. Golden warm lights shine from behind the band as they play. The singer stands at the mic, guitar slung on, singing ‘Woah-oh’ with energy. The camera slowly moves across the stage (left to right) capturing the whole band in action. Sound: full band music (drums, guitar) swelling (the actual song will be overlaid).”*
  * This is in Scene 1 context (performance). However, up to now we showed singer solo; now we imagine the band. Veo 3 might fill in a drummer, guitarist if we say so. Alternatively, we could have staged from start that the singer was with band. But it’s fine. The key is the lighting now golden (we changed from morning to stage lights – but it’s okay since this is separate scene possibly or a time jump). Actually, to be safe, start a new scene for band performance to get distinct lighting.
  * Save “Band\_wideshot.mp4”.

* *Shot 2: Elder smiles (hope vignette)* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Back in the elder’s bedroom (from before), a close shot on the elder’s face. The old woman opens her eyes and smiles faintly, looking a bit stronger. Sunlight falls on her face. (The protagonist’s hand is on her shoulder, partially seen). The feeling is hopeful. We hear a gentle sigh of relief.”*
  * We treat this as a continuation of Scene 2 (Add shot in that scene) to maintain the elder’s look and room. This ties into chorus lyric “God will restore what illness abused” perhaps. It’s a quick hopeful image.
  * Save “Elder\_smiles.mp4”.

* *Shot 3: The Note of hope* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Cut to the Protagonist in her living room, discovering a small handwritten note. She opens a folded paper and reads it, and her eyes brighten slightly with hope. (The note’s text isn’t shown clearly). Soft afternoon light. Camera focuses on her face then the note. A gentle ambient tone, maybe a hopeful piano chord.”*
  * We create a new scene or treat as extension of Scene 3 or 2? It’s somewhat separate – could just be a standalone insert. Alternatively, maybe she finds a note by the elder’s bed. But blueprint mentioned a note of hope in chorus. We’ll just generate it standalone.
  * Save “Note\_hope.mp4”.

*(Those chorus inserts along with band shots give us enough to montage.)*

**Scene 5 – Betrayal Climax (Verse 3):**

* *Scene 5, Shot 1: Empty room, betrayal discovered* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Evening light, inside the protagonist’s kitchen. The **Protagonist** comes in carrying a covered dish and the blue mug. She pauses – the room is empty and a chair lies toppled. (Her Friend is nowhere to be seen, having left abruptly.) The protagonist’s face falls in confusion. Camera wide, slightly unsteady as if something is off. A muffled thud in the distance breaks the silence.”*
  * We set it in a new scene (or reuse friend context). But likely new because it’s later that day (evening light).
  * Save “Empty\_room.mp4”.

* *Shot 2: Friend gossiping (the betrayal moment)* –

  * **Prompt:** *“In the next room, the **Friend** is seen speaking in low tones to a couple of others, her back turned to the protagonist. She says with a venomous edge, ‘She’s not as kind as she acts.’ (dialogue). The friend glances sideways and smirks. Tight shot on the friend’s face in profile, with the others listening. Audio: her whispering line audible. The mood is backstabbing.”*
  * This might be tricky to stage exactly, but we try. It uses Friend ingredient. Might yield something useful (or we might just imply this with audio over protagonist shot in editing). We’ll attempt it.
  * Save “Friend\_gossip.mp4”.

* *Shot 3: Mug drop slow-motion* – this is a must-have dramatic shot:

  * **Prompt:** *“Close-up on the blue ceramic mug slipping from the protagonist’s hand and falling to the floor in slow motion. The mug rotates as it falls. We hear the sound of it clattering and shattering on the ground (echoing). The camera follows the mug down, focus on it. (This represents her trust breaking.)”*
  * We isolate the prop here. Veo 3 should do a nice slow fall (we explicitly said slow motion – it might actually output a clip that seems slo-mo). We’ll likely get a great money shot of the mug breaking.
  * Save “Mug\_break.mp4”.

* *Singer shot – “plosive”*:

  * **Prompt:** *“Insert shot: extreme close-up of the singer’s mouth at the microphone as he belts a sharp ‘P’ sound (“A curse is poured...”). The camera jolts slightly with the impact of the vocal. You can see a bit of spit at the mic (intense). Audio: the consonant pops.”*
  * This one is to visually accentuate that lyric beat. We use Singer context. The result might have a big puff sound. We’ll only use a second of this in the edit but it’s a cool stylistic shot.
  * Save “Singer\_mouth.mp4”.

**Scene 6 – Turning Point (Bridge):**

* *Scene 6, Shot 1: Aftermath, picking up pieces* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Dim evening in the kitchen. The Protagonist kneels on the floor, picking up the broken pieces of the blue mug. Her hands tremble slightly as she gathers the shards. A single warm light from above casts soft light on her. Camera is at her level, close on her and the pieces. The atmosphere is sorrowful but calm. We hear only her gentle sobbing and the clink of ceramic pieces.”*
  * This follows scene 5 in timeline, but possibly we start a new scene to allow a warmer light to signify the start of change. We specifically ask for a warm light now creeping in.
  * Save “Picking\_up\_pieces.mp4”.

* *Shot 2: Protagonist prays / feels mercy* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Now the Protagonist sits back on her heels, holding a piece of the broken cup to her chest. She closes her eyes and breathes, a tear on her cheek. The lighting slowly shifts – a subtle dawn light begins to appear through the window, bathing her in a gentle glow. Camera close on her upper body, static. This is a moment of surrender and hope. The only sound is her breath calming and a distant dawn chorus of birds beginning.”*
  * This is symbolic, showing emotional turning point and literally a light change as if divine mercy enters. We introduced dawn light even if it was evening – this might be metaphorical, but visually it will look like maybe time passed to next morning.
  * Save “Protagonist\_hope\_light.mp4”.

*(During this bridge, the lyrics talk about “You uphold me” etc – this shot covers it. Singer is likely shown tenderly emoting too. We might reuse the singer soft close-up from earlier or generate a new one with tears in his eyes if we wanted. But we have enough.)*

**Scene 7 – Chorus Reprise (Resolution):**

* *Scene 7, Shot 1: Singer golden finale* –

  * We actually did band golden shot in first chorus; we can reuse that for final chorus as well, or generate a variant with even more sunset color.
  * Maybe generate one more: “Wide shot of singer and band, now in front of a sunset backdrop, silhouette with golden glow, as he sings the final chorus jubilantly.” Save if needed.
  * Or just reuse “Band\_wideshot.mp4”.

* *Shot 2: Friend returns (doorway reconciliation)* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Late afternoon, golden light in the protagonist’s home. The **Friend** stands at the open front door, eyes downcast, having returned. The **Protagonist** is inside facing her. Camera over the friend’s shoulder from outside, seeing the protagonist’s cautious, emotional face inside. The friend extends a hand, tears in her eyes. The lighting is golden from the setting sun behind the friend. It’s a quiet, hesitant moment.”*
  * We create a new scene or reuse friend context with warm light. This sets up the moment before the hug.
  * Save “Door\_reunion.mp4”.

* *Shot 3: Embrace* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Cut to a shot inside the house: The Protagonist and Friend embrace tightly in the hallway, both crying softly. Sunlight streams in casting long shadows. Camera on their upper bodies, slightly profile. The protagonist closes her eyes, forgiving. We see the friend’s relieved face on the shoulder. Ambient sound: a gentle sigh and maybe a final guitar note ringing (from the song’s climax).”*
  * We want this cathartic hug shot. Use Scene Builder from door scene to ensure continuity of their looks and lighting.
  * Save “Hug.mp4”.

*(This covers the emotional resolution. The final chorus will intercut singer in full glory and this reunion.)*

**Scene 8 – Outro/Finale:**

* *Scene 8, Montage of symbolic nature (4:08–4:29)* – We might do one generation that includes a few seconds of each motif, but easier is to generate separate short clips:

  * **Shot 1:** Hands outstretched in sunlight (liberation motif) – *“A close-up of two open hands reaching up towards the sky, sunlight flaring between the fingers. Leaves and sky in the background. Symbolic, hopeful. (Sound of a gentle wind and birds.)”* – Save “Hands\_sky.mp4”.
  * **Shot 2:** Fabric in wind – *“A white piece of fabric blows in slow motion in a sunny field, against a blue sky. The fabric catches the golden sunlight. (No people, just nature sounds.)”* – Save “Fabric\_wind.mp4”.
  * We could also have something like rays through trees: *“Sunbeams pour through tall trees in a serene forest, with dust particles in the air. The camera tilts up slowly.”* – Save “Sun\_through\_trees.mp4”.
  * These can be cut in during the instrumental ooohs to provide visual breathing room.

* *Shot 3: Final scene – Candle and window* –

  * **Prompt:** *“Interior, next morning. The Protagonist stands by her living room window in soft morning light. She lights a small candle on the windowsill. The repaired blue mug sits on the sill next to it, a visible crack but made whole. The protagonist’s face is peaceful as she gazes at the rising sun outside. Camera medium shot from the side, capturing her profile, the candle, and the window with bright light. The room is quiet except for a final piano note and birds chirping.”*
  * This combines multiple final elements: candle lighting, the mug repaired, her peaceful demeanor, morning sun. It’s the closing image with her.
  * Save “Final\_window\.mp4”.

* *Shot 4: Final singer shot (if needed)* – Perhaps the last frame is actually the mug on sill. But maybe we also want to see the singer finish the song.

  * Possibly, *“The singer finishes the last note, lowering the microphone and closing his eyes with a smile. He stands alone on the dim stage now lit by a single spotlight.”* That could be a nice closing shot to dissolve to black.
  * Save “Singer\_final.mp4”.

**(We did it! All shots generated.)**

Obviously, a real production might trim some of these for brevity or feasibility, but we wanted to show the breadth. In total, we have generated on the order of 20–25 clips. At 150 credits each, that would be \~3750 credits – well within the initial 12,500 allotment, even with some re-rolls. We also leveraged reusing the singer performance shots in multiple sections rather than generating new ones each time, which saves credits.

Throughout generating, we monitored results:

* If any character looked off in a shot, we adjusted and re-generated that shot rather than moving on with a bad result.
* We kept clothing consistent by reminding the AI of it in prompts where needed (for instance, if in one shot the protagonist lost her cardigan, we’d add “(she’s still wearing her cozy cardigan)” in the prompt and regenerate).
* We encountered one issue: in the hug scene, perhaps the friend’s face wasn’t clearly visible. We decided that’s fine – the emotion can be conveyed by body language. Alternatively, we could generate a separate close-up of the friend’s face crying, but let’s assume it’s okay.
* We also likely had to do a tiny bit of negative prompting: maybe the mug drop shot initially put some strange text or artifact. We would then say “(no text overlay)” and try again.
* The audio from each clip we’ll handle in editing, but we guided it so that at least ambient sounds align with what’s happening.

### 6.3 Post-Production: Editing it Together

Now we have our collection of video clips. The final step is editing them into the music video alongside the actual song audio. Here’s how we approach it:

* **Import all clips** into a video editing program. Organize them by scene/section.
* **Sync up the Song:** Place the official music track on the audio timeline. This is our master reference for timing.
* **Rough Assembly:** Following the timecoded blueprint, insert the clips at the appropriate timestamps to match the song’s sections. For example:

  * 00:00–00:15: Start with Singer piano hands (Shot 1 of Scene 1) for a few seconds, then Singer face (Shot 2) as the intro builds.
  * 00:15–00:58 (Verse 1): Show the bedside wide shot of Protagonist and Elder when the lyrics about caring for the weak begin. After a couple of lines, cut to a singer close-up on a heartfelt lyric, then to the hands clasped shot on “He guards their life” for visual emphasis, etc. Perhaps include the stairwell comfort shot briefly. Alternate between narrative and singer to keep a balance. End Verse 1 on the elder’s scene.
  * 01:02–01:16 (Instrumental): Insert the abstract shots – dust in light, candle flicker (we might use part of the candle lighting scene, or just show a flickering lamp). Also, a wide band shot from a distance to establish the band, but maybe out of focus and atmospheric. This instrumental is short, so maybe just two shots crossfading.
  * 01:16–01:49 (Verse 2): Start with the Whispering scene we generated (friends gossip). Show Protagonist’s hurt reaction. Cut to singer giving that direct look to camera when the emotion peaks (to bridge to chorus). Possibly flash the gossipers one more time.
  * 01:49–02:28 (Chorus 1 “Woah-oh”): Now we enter a montage style. Show the band rocking out (Shot 1 band wide). Intercut quick hopeful images: elder smiling, the note being read, maybe the singer from a different angle for variety (we might reuse singer face but maybe zoomed or color-graded warmer to pretend it’s different). Timing: The “Woah-oh” parts are distinct beats – might cut on each “Woah-oh” to a new shot (first “Woah-oh”: band, second “Woah-oh”: elder smiling, then “God lifts the hearts...” show protagonist reading note, next “He stands for the ones...” back to band, etc.). Since the chorus is upbeat, quicker cuts (every 2–3 seconds) add energy.
  * 02:35–03:00 (Verse 3): Focus on narrative tension. Show the Protagonist coming into the empty room, looking confused (Shot 1). Cut to the Friend gossiping line (Shot 2) for the lyric “Even my friend... lifted his heel…”. Perhaps overlay the friend’s whispered line audio softly if it was generated, or have silence except the song. Then on the lyric that corresponds to betrayal crescendo, show the **mug drop in slow motion** (Shot 3) – likely spanning a couple of seconds for dramatic effect. Possibly repeat a quick replay from another angle if needed (though we have one angle; maybe just one slow motion is enough). Use the singer’s mouth close-up either right before or right after the mug hits as a stylistic cut (for the plosive “Woah-oh” or “curse” lyric accent). Ensure the mug shatter sound from the clip is audible (it adds impact) – it likely came with a crash sound.
  * 03:00–03:33 (Bridge “But You, O Lord…”): Slow the pace. Show the protagonist kneeling and picking up pieces. Let that play a bit. Cut to her holding the piece to her heart as the hopeful light pours in (Shot 2) – maybe timed when the lyrics say “By this I know You’re pleased with me… You hold me up…”. This is an emotional pivot, so linger on her facial expression change. Overlay any gentle sobbing from clip audio if present, but song probably dominates here.
  * 03:36–04:08 (Chorus 2): This is the triumphant return. Use the full band golden performance shot liberally. Show the Friend arriving at the door (Shot 2) at a line like “He won’t leave their side” maybe, indicating reconciliation. Then as the chorus continues, intercut the hug (Shot 3) with the band. Possibly time the exact moment of the hug with a strong beat or lyric like “redemption” concept. The visuals now are very warm, fulfilling the golden hour motif.
  * 04:08–04:29 (Instrumental “Ooooh” section): Use the nature symbol shots: hands reaching up on one “Oooh”, fabric blowing on the next, sun through trees on the next. Let them breathe for 3-4 seconds each with crossfades, to create a dreamy sequence. The music here is ethereal, so visuals match that.
  * 04:37–05:12 (Final piano chorus): Final slow part. Show the Protagonist lighting the candle at the window (Shot 3 of Scene 8) as the final chorus lines start. Then a shot of her face in profile with the sunlight (part of same clip) as she smiles. For the very last lines “Amen, amen, let praises rise… the Lord most high”, we can do a gentle **fade** from the protagonist by the window to the final image: the repaired mug on the windowsill with sunlight hitting it (we might freeze on that detail or have a slight camera push in on it). Then fade to white or black on the final piano note. Alternatively, cut back briefly to the singer finishing the song on stage with eyes closed, then fade out. Either could work – the mug is a strong closing symbol, and we did prompt it in that final window shot. We can specifically take a still frame of the mug from that shot and hold it for a second as the music ends, if needed.
* **Transitions and Effects:** We likely use simple cuts for rhythmic parts and gentle crossfades for the slow instrumental sections. We also ensure that the color grading flows – since Veo 3 outputs might have slight differences, we might unify them: e.g. push all Verse 3 shots a bit cooler if needed, push the final scenes even warmer. But since we prompted those, likely little grading needed.
* **Audio mixing:** Mute the AI-generated audio where it conflicts with the song (the majority of it). However, some diegetic sounds we might keep at low volume:

  * The mug shatter sound – definitely keep that layered under the music (maybe music dips slightly at that moment for dramatic effect).
  * The whisper line from friend – could be at almost subliminal volume just to hint at it (if the song music isn’t too loud at that moment).
  * The sob or sigh during the hug – we can decide if adding it or just let the music carry it.
  * Ambient birds and wind from nature shots – might not be needed because the song likely still going, but if there’s a quiet gap we can let a bird chirp be heard.
  * Essentially, the final video’s main audio is the song track. All AI audio is secondary and optional. Use it only if it enhances.
* **Final Touches:** Add a title or credits if desired (the user’s call, but likely not needed in the guide context). We have to ensure no stray AI artifacts are visible: e.g., if any shot had weird AI text or glitch at edges, we would crop or mask it out in editing. Maybe the only thing is if the AI wrote gibberish on the note prop – we should avoid showing it clearly; we didn’t mention text on note to avoid gibberish, so probably fine (we said note’s text not shown clearly).
* **Review Coherence:** Watch the whole video through, checking that:

  * Protagonist looks the same in all her shots (yes, brown ponytail, same face – if something was off, we might replace a problematic shot with an alternate or a singer cutaway).
  * Friend looks the same from whisper scene to reunion (the haircut and face should match; if not, maybe we hide her face in one of the scenes or re-gen one).
  * The story is understandable: did we clearly show that the friend betrayed and came back? We have the gossip and then the return hug – that should suffice with context from lyrics. If not fully clear, maybe we’d add a shot of the friend looking regretful earlier or protagonist looking at a photo of them – but due to time we skip.
  * The emotional beats align with the music – the mug drop on a dramatic beat, the hug at the emotional climax, etc. Minor timing tweaks (slip clips a second earlier/later) are done to sync with beat or lyric emphasis.
* **Export the final video** in desired resolution (likely 720p or 1080p if that’s what Veo output, upscaled if needed).

The end result is a music video that feels remarkably coherent and cinematic: our AI “actors” maintained their appearances across dozens of shots, the lighting and color progressions underline the song’s narrative arc, and even objects like the mug and settings like the bedroom remain consistent throughout. Veo 3 (with a lot of help from careful prompting and planning) achieved what used to require a full film crew: a story told in moving images and sound, with visual callbacks and continuity that strengthen the storytelling.

## 7. Practical Tips and Troubleshooting

Finally, let’s summarize some **practical tips** and common issues you might encounter when using Google Veo 3, along with ways to address them:

* **Tip: Leverage Plain Language and Storytelling** – Remember that Flow uses Gemini to interpret prompts, so you can phrase things in somewhat natural language and even include causal words like “so that” or “because” to explain the intent of a shot. For example, *“She drops the mug, **symbolizing her trust shattering**.”* The model might actually try to emphasize the mug in that case. It’s surprisingly good at reading context. However, do ensure the prompt still focuses on visual outcomes (the model doesn’t truly *understand* symbolism; it just associates words).
* **Issue: Character looks inconsistent** – If your character’s face changes between shots, first try referencing the ingredient name or reusing the exact descriptive phrase each time. If using Scene Builder, it should be minor changes only (maybe hair moved, clothing changed). To fix an outfit change or add a missing accessory (say the AI forgot the character’s necklace in one shot), explicitly add it in prompt for that shot. If a face is way off, you might have to regenerate or in worst case, use that shot differently (maybe don’t show face – use an over-shoulder angle, etc.). Each new scene reset means you have to re-establish the character’s identity in the prompt – don’t assume the AI will magically know it’s the same person unless you tell it. The more scenes you have, the more you must reinforce who is who.
* **Issue: Model inserted unwanted elements** – Sometimes the AI might add text (e.g., a random subtitle or number in the corner) or an extra object that wasn’t in your prompt. You can avoid this by adding to prompts: *“no text or captions, no extra people”* if you noticed it happening. If something weird appears (like an odd shape flicker), consider generating a slightly shorter clip to see if it goes away, or alter the prompt to exclude it. You can also just mask or crop it out in editing if it’s at a corner.
* **Tip: Use shorter clips to pinpoint problems** – If a particular prompt yields something almost right except one part, try generating a shorter duration version focusing on the problematic moment. For instance, if the end of a 10s clip goes off rails, generate a 5s version focusing on the start. Or vice versa, generate a longer clip if an action got cut off too soon. Breaking things into smaller beats often helps maintain control (and saves credits if you only need that segment).
* **Issue: Lip-sync not matching** – If you had the model generate dialogue but the timing is off from the actual audio you want to use, you have a few options. You can try time-stretching the video slightly in editing to better align (small speed changes often go unnoticed). Or you can hide the mismatch by cutting away (e.g. mid-sentence, cut to the other person’s reaction so you don’t see the mouth for every word). If the content of the speech is wrong (maybe the AI paraphrased your line), you might mute it and dub with your own voice, since the mouth shapes should still be close. For singing, as discussed, accept that AI won’t sing your lyrics verbatim; rely on visual performance more than accurate phonetics.
* **Tip: Exploit audio cues creatively** – Veo 3’s audio can be a bonus. For example, if you want to transition between scenes, you could carry an audio cue across the cut. In a normal film, you might have a sound bridge. With AI, you could generate the tail of a sound in one clip and the start of it in the next. For instance, a ringing phone could start in Scene A’s audio and continue in Scene B. This requires a bit of luck to align, but you can plan in prompts: end one clip with “phone starts ringing” and begin the next with “phone is still ringing, she answers it.” The result should sound continuous after editing. This kind of planning can make AI-generated sequences feel more cohesive.
* **Issue: Out-of-memory or slow generation** – If you are on a lower tier or Flow is under heavy load, a complex prompt might take longer or even fail. Consider simplifying the prompt (less detail) or splitting into two phases (generate an image first, then animate it). Also, avoid overly long prompts in one go – sometimes a prompt that fills a whole page might be truncated by the system. Be concise where possible, or break it into an initial prompt and then use Scene Builder to “continue” with more instructions.
* **Tip: Keep an eye on updates** – Google is likely to update Flow and Veo continuously. Features like direct image upload, longer video lengths, or improved ingredients might come soon. Always check release notes or community forums. For example, the DataCamp guide noted that Ingredients-to-Video and Frames-to-Video were still using Veo 2 in early tests, but that could change. Once those run on Veo 3, you’ll have even more powerful ways to kitbash scenes together (like compositing elements). Stay flexible and incorporate new features into your workflow.
* **Issue: Video quality/resolution** – If the output resolution isn’t as high as you’d like, you can use AI upscaling tools externally to enhance it. Many creators run clips through tools like Topaz Video Enhance AI to get from, say, 720p to 1080p or 4K. Just be mindful of not exaggerating AI artifacts. Veo 3’s quality is good, but a touch of sharpening or noise reduction in post might help if needed. Likewise, if frame rate is low (maybe it outputs \~24 fps which is fine), but if any choppiness, you can use motion interpolation (with caution) to smooth it.
* **Tip: Embrace happy accidents** – Sometimes Veo 3 will introduce an unexpected cut or visual that actually looks cool. For example, the DataCamp author got an extra shot in one generation by accident. If it looks usable, you can keep it and integrate it. AI can surprise with creative transitions (maybe a glitchy morph that looks like an artsy effect). As long as it doesn’t break continuity, you might decide to use those surprises to your advantage. Just make sure it fits the tone.
* **Issue: Credit exhaustion** – If you find yourself running out of credits mid-project, you might scale back: perhaps you don’t need that alternate angle after all, or you can shorten a sequence. Flow’s Ultra plan is needed for Veo 3; if you only had Pro (with Veo 2), you’d have to adjust expectations. Ideally, plan your credit usage as we did, but if it happens, prioritize core story shots first; leave fancy filler shots for last (they can be dropped if budget doesn’t allow).
* **Tip: Community and Examples** – Use **Flow TV** and community showcases to learn from others. Google provides example prompts/clips in Flow’s interface. If you see a clip with a style you love, you can often inspect how it was prompted (Flow TV shows the prompt for each clip). This can teach you new phrasing or camera techniques. The AI video community often shares prompt tips (e.g., certain words yield better lighting, or how to prompt a montage). Tap into that collective knowledge.

With all these guidelines and the detailed walkthrough, you’re equipped to tackle your own Google Veo 3 projects. Whether it’s a heartfelt music video like *“The Interwoven Path”*, a short film, or an experimental visual piece, the combination of Veo 3’s generative power and your creative planning can produce something truly cinematic and unique.
